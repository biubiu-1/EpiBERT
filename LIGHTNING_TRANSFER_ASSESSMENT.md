# EpiBERT to PyTorch Lightning Transfer: Complete Assessment

## Executive Summary

**Can EpiBERT be completely transferred to Lightning?** **YES**, but it requires a **major rewrite** rather than simple adaptation.

**Effort Required:** **8-12 weeks** for a complete, production-ready transfer by an experienced team.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### EpiBERT (TensorFlow Implementation)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.12.0 + Keras
- **Model**: Custom transformer with convolutional stems for genomic sequence analysis  
- **Training**: Manual distributed training loops with `@tf.function` decorators
- **Data**: TFRecord format with complex preprocessing pipeline
- **Size**: ~2,500 lines of core implementation code

### Key Components:
1. **Multi-modal inputs**: DNA sequence, ATAC-seq profiles, motif activity
2. **Convolutional processing**: Separate stems for sequence and ATAC data
3. **Transformer architecture**: 8-layer transformer with rotary position embeddings
4. **Masking strategy**: Masked language modeling approach for genomic data
5. **Distributed training**: Manual TensorFlow strategy implementation

- Ensure identical preprocessing steps
- Handle genomic data specifics (reverse complement, masking)

### 3. Training Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
**Complexity: LOW-MEDIUM**
- Adapt loss functions and metrics
- Configure Lightning trainer and callbacks  
- Set up logging and monitoring
- Test distributed training

### 4. Testing & Validation (2-3 weeks)
**Complexity: MEDIUM**
- Validate model convergence matches original
- Test distributed training performance
- Benchmark memory usage and speed
- Ensure identical outputs on same data

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Areas:
1. **Data conversion**: TFRecord ‚Üí PyTorch format migration
2. **Numerical precision**: Ensuring identical model outputs
3. **Performance**: Matching original training speed/memory usage
4. **Distributed training**: Validating multi-GPU performance

### üü° Medium Risk Areas:
1. **Custom layer equivalence**: SoftmaxPooling, attention mechanisms
2. **Data augmentation**: Replicating genomic-specific augmentations
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: May need adjustment for PyTorch

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas:
1. **Training infrastructure**: Lightning handles most complexity
2. **Logging/monitoring**: Built-in WandB integration
3. **Model checkpointing**: Automatic management

## Recommendation

### For Production Transfer:
**Recommended approach**: Gradual migration with parallel validation
1. **Phase 1** (2 weeks): Set up Lightning framework and basic model
2. **Phase 2** (3 weeks): Complete model architecture with validation  
3. **Phase 3** (3 weeks): Data pipeline conversion and testing
4. **Phase 4** (2 weeks): Performance optimization and distributed training
5. **Phase 5** (2 weeks): Final validation and production deployment
